== Building ==
These instructions are tested on Ubuntu 11.04

Dependencies:
On Ubuntu 11.04, a RouteFlow setup requires the following packages to be installed:
build-essential iproute-dev libboost-all-dev swig1.3

Then, for each external dependency:
Open vSwitch v1.10: linux-headers-generic

NOX v0.9 (bundled with RouteFlow): autoconf automake g++ libtool swig make git-core libboost-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libssl-dev libpcap-dev python-twisted python-simplejson python-dev

MongoDB v2.0.2: git-core build-essential scons libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-filesystem-dev

[Open vSwitch install instructions]
[NOX install instructions]
[MongoDB install instructions]

You can compile all RouteFlow applications by running the following command in the project root:

make all

You can also compile them individually:

make slave
make server
make controller

After the build, you can run tests 1 and 2. The setup to run them is described at the end of this document.
