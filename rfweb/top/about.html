    </div>

    <div id="top-popout-body">
	<p><b>RouteFlow</b> is an architecture following the SDN paradigm based on a programmatic approach to logically centralize the network control. It is composed by <b>OpenFlow</b> Controller application and an independent <b>RouteFlow</b> server that manages a virtual network environment to interconnect virtualized IP routing engines.</p>
        <p><b>RouteFlow</b> is about combining the line-rate performance of OpenFlow-enabled networking gear with the flexibility of open-source routing stacks in order to deliver novel models of virtual routers and IP Networks-as-a-Service in the open networking era. </p>
	<p>The focus of this demonstration is showcasing the <b>RouteFlow</b> architecture in the provision of traditional IP routing (e.g., OSPF, BGP) on top of an <b>OpenFlow</b>-enabled infrastructure. By understanding how the <b>RouteFlow</b> platform orchestrates and dynamically links (remote) virtualized routing protocol stacks (e.g., Quagga, XORP), demo visitors will be able to devise how an open software-defined networking approach allows for innovation in the delivery of virtual IP routing and forwarding services.</p>
